        <h2 class="subtitle">The Research</h2>

        <p class="content research">Heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, strokes, hypertension, and cholesterol all have a common enemy: the vegan diet! This page accumulates the latest nutrition research from around the world about the effects of vegetarian and vegan diets. It will be updated frequently.</p>

        <ul>
            <li class="content research">Vegans tend to be thinner, have lower serum cholesterol, and lower blood pressure, reducing their risk of heart disease. <a target="_blank" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1627S.full">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">Vegetarian diets confer protection against cardiovascular diseases, cardiometabolic risk factors, some cancers and total mortality. Compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, vegan diets offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/6/2131/htm">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">Vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease, largely explained by low LDL cholesterol, probable lower rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower prevalence of obesity. Overall, their cancer rates appear to be moderately lower than others living in the same communities, and life expectancy appears to be greater. <a target="_blank" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/89/5/1607S.short">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">Plant-based diets lower cholesterol just as effectively as statin drugs, without the side effects. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14527636">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">A low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet recommendations. <a target="_blank" href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2009/04/01/ajcn.2009.26736H.short">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">Vegetarians have a lower mean BMI (by about 1 kg/m2), a lower mean plasma total cholesterol concentration (by about 0.5 mmol/l), and a lower mortality from coronary artery disease (by about 25 %). <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/health-benefits-of-a-vegetarian-diet/8774207AE8B2CCB4A90D6ADDBC9EA89F">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. <a target="_blank" href="http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/19562864">Source</a></li>

            <li class="content research">The three boosters of bad cholesterol (transfat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol) all stem from eating animal products and processed junk foods. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21521229">Source</a></li>
