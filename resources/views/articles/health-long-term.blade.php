        <h2 class="subtitle">The Research</h2>

        <p class="content research">Heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, strokes, hypertension, and cholesterol all have a common enemy: the vegan diet! The purpose of this page is to accumulate and distill the scientific research about nutrition and diet and present it in easily consumable chunks that real humans can understand.</p>

        <p class="content research">For example, often when reading scientific research I run across a sentence like this:</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="content research">Regarding cause-specific mortality, men and women had elevated risks for cancer mortality for red (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.16-1.29], and HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12-1.30], respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-1.19], and HR, 1.11 [95% CI 1.04-1.19], respectively) intakes. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease risk was elevated for men and women in the highest quintile of red (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.20-1.35], and HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65], respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03-1.15], and HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.26-1.51], respectively) intakes. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19307518">Source</a> </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="content research">Although to most people this means nothing, it can be translated from scientist-speak to human. What it really means is:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>People who ate the most red meat were 20% more likely to die of cancer and at least 27% more likely to die of heart disease than those who ate the least. In women who consumed the most meat, the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease was 50% higher.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Obesity, Heart Disease, Diabetes, & High Blood Pressure</h2>

        <p class="content research">The links between all of these diseases are too strong to separate, but the outcomes are impossible to ignore. A vegan diet protects against all of these deadly conditions.</p>

                Vegetarians have a lower mean BMI (by about 1 kg/m2), a lower mean plasma total cholesterol concentration (meaning they are less susceptible to diabetes), and a lower mortality from coronary artery disease (by about 25%).</li>

                Vegetarians have lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. </li>

                Vegetarian diets confer protection against cardiovascular diseases, cardiometabolic risk factors, some cancers and total mortality. Compared to lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, vegan diets offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality.</li>

                Vegetarians have lower rates of coronary heart disease, largely explained by low LDL cholesterol, probable lower rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and lower prevalence of obesity. Overall, their cancer rates appear to be moderately lower than others living in the same communities, and life expectancy appears to be greater.</li>
