Vegaroo is for people who are interested in consuming fewer animal products, whether it is because they want to improve their health, reduce their environmental impact, stop causing harm to animals, or for any other religious, cultural, or moral reasons.


Simple
Keep things as easy as possible
We want you to make and enjoy these meals, not to worry about anything else
You don't give a fuck about my life - you just want to eat well!

Fast
Every recipe on Vegaroo is ready in less than 30 minutes.

Easy
No recipes are dependent on complicated cooking techniques or special kitchen items. If you have a knife, cutting board, pots and pans, and an oven, you are ready to go. If you have a blender, that's helpful too!

Accessible
None of our recipes are dependent on special ingredients like hemp seed oil, nutritional yeast, or xantham gum. (WTF is that?) Everything should be available in a normal grocery store. If you encounter any items that you cannot find at your local grocery store, please contact us!

Delicious
Eating more vegetables should be enjoyable! We don't want to feel like you're missing out on something, so we've taken care to assemble excellent combinations of flavors that we love too.

Nutritious
Many people have different definitions of what a nutritious meal is. Here at Vegaroo, we believe that nutrition is an evolving science and are always open to learning new things about what constitutes a healthy diet.

That being said, our stance on nutrition currently stands as follows:
- The healthiest foods are unprocessed and plant-based (think fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains)
- Processed plant-based foods can be unhealthy, depending on how they are prepared (don't forget that a diet consisting of beer, doritos, oreos, and french fries cooked in vegetable oil is vegan!)
- Unprocessed animal foods are not necessarily healthy, but better than processed ones (like chicken breast, natural yogurt)
- Processed animal foods should be avoided at all costs (for example: hot dogs, lunch meats, flavored yogurts)

With regards to nutrients, the three most important ones are:
- Protein
- Fiber
- Sugar
