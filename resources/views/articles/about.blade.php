Nutritious
Many people have different definitions of what a nutritious meal is. Here at Vegaroo, we believe that nutrition is an evolving science and are always open to learning new things about what constitutes a healthy diet.

That being said, our stance on nutrition currently stands as follows:
- The healthiest foods are unprocessed and plant-based (think fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains)
- Processed plant-based foods can be unhealthy, depending on how they are prepared (don't forget that a diet consisting of beer, doritos, oreos, and french fries cooked in vegetable oil is vegan!)
- Unprocessed animal foods are not necessarily healthy, but better than processed ones (like chicken breast, natural yogurt)
- Processed animal foods should be avoided at all costs (for example: hot dogs, lunch meats, flavored yogurts)

With regards to nutrients, the three most important ones are:
- Protein
- Fiber
- Sugar
