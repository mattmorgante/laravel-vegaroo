Welcome to Vegaroo 

Hey there, 

Thanks for creating one of the first ever accounts on Vegaroo! I'm Matt, the creator of this silly little website and I'm getting in touch today to make sure you have the best experience possible while using Vegaroo. 

Vegaroo is on a mission to make it easier for people to go vegan using three main features:

1. Tools: track your daily dozen intake and (brand new!) save your favorite recipes   
2. Recipes: fast, easy and delicious plant-based meals that any home cook can conquer
3. Resources: simple articles and shareable insights about the benefits of veganism: 

In the coming weeks I'm going to be developing new features for the website, so now it's your time to shine! Simply respond to this message with your dreams or desires for the ideal vegan website and I will do my best to make them a reality. Additionally if you have any feedback or questions about the current features, fire away.

Finally, I want to ask you a tiny little favor. Do you know someone who might find Vegaroo useful? It would be amazing if you could share the website with them today! Just a few moments of your time would make a big difference to the future of Vegaroo.

Thanks again and I truly hope to hear back from you soon!
Matt
