  Luca's ideas: 
  - more trees means less C02
  - Carbon is dangerous, poses a threat to the species. 
  - Must try to balance it 
  - Build incentives into the system that reward people for reducing C02
  - Donate to the tree farms around the world! 
  
  Matt's ideas: 
  - More warming means a smaller amount of arable land to create food 
  - Higher population growth means we need more food 
  - We face severe food shortages 
  - Invest in / donate to companies creating sustainable indoor food  
  
  
  - Clean businesses: ones that produce a better output than what they put in 
    - Clean energy 
    - Clean water 
    - Clean foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains)
  
  - Healthy Foods: make sure that organic or other healthy foods are actually what they say.
     - This an idea for the future. Something to research and keep an eye on.
