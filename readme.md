2. points system
- total score: on dashboard along with total servings for all time

- demo mode? video? compelling post on reddit and nutrition facts

Published Feb 23rd?? track registration while building new features. Join button = build with me. Need at least 10 people to continue to phase 2.

Phase 2 = Expand Recipes
A. Expand Recipes
1. User has the ability to search and filter for recipes = Searchable recipes as SEO content
Save a recipe
- to recipe add field
-- tags = explode on ,

to user add field
- saved_recipe_ids = explode on ,

- show page my favorites
Start charging once people save recipes / upvote and submit links


3. build a script to scrape external websites for websites
- get pictures and details from bloggers
- parse time, title, calories, etc into current db structure
- to recipe add fields external (0 or 1), seo description,

4. User can share a recipe

5. user has the ability to create a recipe with bowl/salad generator
the script can power an empire of relevant content, then just build community features on top of it
Deadline = get 50 meals: Then you have an seo schedule
vegan meals
vegan recipes
best vegan recipes
vegan dinner recipes
best vegan bowls
Less than 30 minute vegan meals
vegan lunch recipes
vegan cookies
vegan cakes
vegan pizzas
vegan bowls

- commuicate with bloggers - this can help them!
- ask for backlinks on recipes that use them (widget or link)

simple homepage with a search bar and background images (find your next favorite vegan recipe)
- at the bottom suggestions / tags to SEO pages
- results = first search for title, then description
- show link with photo, description (just like google), but on the right you can share or save!



B. Expand Community - increase registration
- via a Forum and Votable Commentable automated content
- anyone can see, but only users can give a rating / vote / submit info (7 days free trial)
1. User can submit a link or text field to a forum - links are votable and commentable (recipes too)-
- create a Front Page with three categories (just like the dashboard)
- environment impact, nutritional impact, uplifting impact (supportive socially or saving animals - veganism has the power to bring compassion to the world in a profound way)


2. Users can Review products (like nomadlist gear)
- Ranking System for Products === Affiliate marketing
- what about a ranking system for vegan cookbooks? milk substitutes? burgers / meat replacements? <-- this is an expanding field
- ability for a user to give a review/rating to a vegan meat / dairy replacements
- ability for user to submit a product and a review/rating
- both brand and non-branded grocery items/foods
- product reviews / endorsements
- best vegan cookbooks, bloggers, youtube channels, podcasts,

- picture
- shares?

4. Food and Food Category food detail pages = Research about vegan foods as SEO content
detail pages for food groups: starting with cruciferous
detail pages for foods: the vegan superfoods - shareable digital cards
- not automatable, not high seo wise, but i want to do it
- everything you need to know about kale
- everything about cauliflower, broccoli, chia seeds  
- why they healthy, which minerals they got, studies they are used in, then which recipes you can find them

C. Longer term idea:
vegan food near me - filter google api reviews to mapbox coordinates : search for vegan, raw, vegeterian options in title, description, tags, or reviews
- worldwide map of vegan restaurants
- cover it city by city - do one city first (amsterdam!!)
- automate the process

join
- login with google or facebook
- what is this?
- dashboard to track your consumption of the healthiest, disease-preventing foods: dubbed the daily dozen by the book how not to die
- community to invite people to build this - chat group to provide feedback simple forum / open dev board
- Make it a community

  Luca's ideas:
  - more trees means less C02
  - Carbon is dangerous, poses a threat to the species.
  - Must try to balance it
  - Build incentives into the system that reward people for reducing C02
  - Donate to the tree farms around the world!

  Matt's ideas:
  - More warming means a smaller amount of arable land to create food
  - Higher population growth means we need more food
  - We face severe food shortages
  - Invest in / donate to companies creating sustainable indoor food

  - Clean businesses: ones that produce a better output than what they put in
    - Clean energy
    - Clean water
    - Clean foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains)

  Pain point:
  - Hard to keep track of what is environmentally friendly

  - Healthy Foods: make sure that organic or other healthy foods are actually what they say.
